# Combination-Logic-Design-Circuit
 It is used to perform the addition and subtraction of BCD numbers. A BCD digit can have any of ten possible four-bit representations. Suppose, we have two 4-bit numbers A and B. The value of A and B can vary from 0(0000 in binary) to 9(1001 in binary) because we are considering decimal numbers.
